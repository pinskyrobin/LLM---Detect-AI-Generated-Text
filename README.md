# LLM---Detect-AI-Generated-Text

Demo code and dataset for offline debugging.

This repository is only for those who want to debug the code locally.
It can not be used as local validation unless modifying the dataset.

## Modification

Data in `test_essays.csv` is partially copied from `train_essays` for more convenient debugging.
Since the last block of the notebook will not be debugged when using the oringinal 3-line test data.

## Acknowledgement

Code is referenced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mfmfmf3/clean-code-detect-ai-generated).

Apart from the [official dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data),
we also consider add another popular dataset [DAIGT V2 Train Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset).

Thanks for all the authors' contribution!
