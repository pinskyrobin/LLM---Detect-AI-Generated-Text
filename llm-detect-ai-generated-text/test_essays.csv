ca99f3b0,0,"The time for the automobile is slowly passing. More and more people prefer carpooling and walking then driving a car. Why is that? It could be due to the unemployment rate skyrocketing or less people wanting a car. There are many benefits to driving a car. Being able to get to point A to point B, faster travel time, and it is more private than a bus. But what are the downsides? Pollution, more antisocial humans, and the cacophony of horns and engines. Giving up the car should be on every countries todo list.

Some nations, such as Paris, France, find out about the downside of cars the hardway. Pollution is a very real problem in todays society. In 2014 the city had a nearrecord high of pollution, rivaling Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world source 2. After debating, the French ruling party decided to ban driving for odd and even licence plate numbers on opposite days until the smog count went down. It took five days, but they managed to have most of the smog cleared. Decisions like these cause controversy everywhere, but we have a responsibility to our planet not to destroy it with greenhouse gases.

In a suburb in Germany, they have a carfree neighborhood. They are allowed to own cars but it costs 40,000 and they can only park at the edge of the neighborhood. This alone caused 70% of the neighborhood to not own cars source 1. A woman in Vauban,the neighborhood,said that not owning a car makes her less tense and more happy. With this you can conclude that most of her neighbors feel this way also, otherwise they wouldn't have moved there. Having less stressed people, less polluted airways and less car accidents always sounds like a good solution to me.

In a city in Columbia they have a carfree day, where cars are banned from the city source 3. Even though it was rainy it did not stop people from participating at all. In fact, it has even spread across its borders. A businessman said this was a good way to lower stress swell. Without cars, this city has seen more bikeway paths, parks and community centers being built and rush hour traffic being cut down dramtically. This new trend has promoted people to be more healthy and social. Not only has this affected the airs it has affected business. With more people walking, new restaurants and shopping centers have cropped up. Having more and more people spending their money helps their nations economy in great ways.

After all this evidence the only conclusion we can come to is that having less cars would help humans immensly. Not only does it promote physical exercise but but cuts down on polution. Yes, it would have hurt car manufacturers but the businessmen don't exactly just lay down and take it. Bill Ford has already suggested working with the new trend source 4. Without cars the obesity problem, especially in America, would decrease. As well as the number of asthmatic people. Taking this data and doing something with it would not only help the life living on this planet, but it would help the planet too."
cab59ae3,0,"Cars have been part of our daily lives for decades and have become somewhat idolized in American culture. But cars are slowly killing our planet and are speeding up the Greenhouse effect taking place within our Earths atmosphere. We've become entirely too dependent on cars to get us where we wish to go, making many people lazy. Cars also emit gasses that can harm our internal body structures, causing problems with lung diseases and just the simple act of breathing. Many cities from all over the world have taken measures to limit the use of cars in daily life, making their homes cleaner and healthier to live in. More cities should start to do this as well to help save our planet and ourselves.

Environmentalists have hated cars for a long time because of the harmful effect it has to air we breathe. When nearrecord levels of smog filled the air of Paris, they enforced a temporary driving an in efforts to reduce the smog and within five days the smog cleared enough to allow citizens to start driving once again. In America, the number of drivers and car owners has been steadily reducing since 2005 and many experts believe it will continue to. A revolution could be started if enough people stop driving personal vehicles and instead walk, bike, or even just use public transportation.

People have adjusted over the years to things being given to them without them doing much to get it. Cars contribute to this and have caused laziness in many car owners. In Bogota, Columbia they have initiated and annual carfree day where everyone has to get to their jobs by means of biking or walking or taking public transportation. Carlos arturo Plaza rides his twoseat bicycle with his wife to work and both like the idea of limiting air pollution caused by cars. Pollution from cars can be dangerous for humans as well as the environment. By breathing in harsh gases we could acquire diseases such as COPD and lung cancer. Cars allow people to live unhealthy lifestyles in comfort while unknowing of the harm its causing. They are an insidious problem.

Cars have been gradually degenerating the planet and harming the people who use them. Thankfully many officials are working hard to limit this but we all have to contribute."
cad31d61,0,"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their carfree days source 3. Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may ""buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way source 1,"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow."
cb2a22f1,0,"You and I both know very well that we love to breath fresh air. Going out into the forest and taking a big breath of what is called ""fresh air."" Why cant we get that in an everyday life? I'll tell you why, because of polution. Cars are a ginormous part of polution, so what if we drove less?

In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars almost completely. The streets in Vauban are ""car free."" If you want a car, you have to park it at a local park garage for 40,000 dollars added onto your house. That isnt even worth paying for. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She lives in this town so she knows how it is. Giving up a car can reduce stress! Boy do some people need to give up cars.

America's obeisity count is getting higher and higher by the month. What if we gave up cars? people would have to walk everywhere! That's a good way to get exercise. In passage 1 it says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Stores are helping people out so they can walk to get what they need instead of driving.

It will be so much less expensive in everyday life if you dont have a car. You won't have to pay for gas, you won't have to pay for car insurance and you won't have to pay for mantanence! You also will not have to pay something crazy like ""40,000, along with a home."" If I had to pay that much more money to keep up with a car, I would give it up in an instant. I barely have enough money to support the car alone, there is no way i can pay an extra 40,000 dollars!

Not having a car seems easier and healthier to me! You can walk more, so you get you exercise in everyday. You dont have to spend money on the car, no gas, no insurance and no mantanance! That means you can spend it on important stuff, perhaps on schooling! You also dont have as much stress on your hands. You dont have to worry about stopped traffic because you can just walk, ride a bike, or jog to where ever you have a desire to go. I say we get rid of cars all together in the United States of America."
cba3c89f,1,"Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win,and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""What Is the Electoral College?,1, but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Lets go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, because it happened once and for sure it could happen again, Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc. the government takes care of the people, like it they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system alloys for much worse""Plumer,1. This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against their original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""Posner,1.

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plumer says in a expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaing , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Soth California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs and the beliefs of hundreds is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster and it can choose the candidate the public is not haoory with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" Plumer,1."
cbc48dd7,0,"Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of nearrecord pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment."
cc01c188,1,"I believe that we should change the system to ""election by popular vote"". If we were to change the way we elect our president im sure citizens would be more pleased with the over all outcome. People vote on who they think is best fit to represent them and give them the best over all outcome. When using the ""electoral college"" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The ""electoral college"" is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. It is time to change our voting methods because the ""electoral college"" system is outdated, irrational, and unfair to citizens.

When people place their vote they believe they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. The ""electoral college"" is a very nondemocratic way of selecting your president. In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress. But instead once they place their vote it goes to electors rather than a simple vote towards the one they selected. If you were to change the way people's votes were counted it would be easier and faster to elect a president and get him into office to fix worldwide problems.

In all three articles at least one section has made it clear on their opinion to abolish the electoral college. Figures such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. When voting for president you are voting for a slate of electors, but do we even know who these supposed electors are! Are votes are being manipulated and we are not even aware of who is doing it. If we can not vote for are president without going through electors we should be able to vote for the electors who are voting for are president. It is only fair that we have some say in everything that is going on. When votes are being placed we should be informed of all that is going on.

If you were to vote for your favorite to show but your vote had to go through twenty different people all with different opinions you would be frustrated. Now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than a television show, the president. You are trusting possibly the next four years of your life with strangers in which you have never heard of before. It would only be fair if we could simply change the system to popular vote rather than electoral college.

If you switch to popular vote more people would be more likely to vote because they could have more confidence about their vote. They would feel free to make their own decision and trust it would not be tampered with by a stranger. People deserve a fair vote and with the popular vote that is what you are giving them. Because every living being deserves equality. Changing the system would not only be helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress. Instead of having random members of congress choose the president they can work on serious issues around the world. They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs.

In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I believe that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. So to end my argument I simply say think before you act and truly try to do whats right."
cc1dca35,0,"It is hard to imagine carfree or car limiting cities, but it could happen in the near future. Many people like owning and driving cars. However, cars are causing major problems in some areas of the world, so we could see less cars in the future.

One of the biggest issues that cars cause is the carbon emissions that they release. In America, the second largest source of emissions are from cars Source 4. This doesn't seem like an issue to Americans, but in places like Beijing, China, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world Source 2, emissions are very harmful. Citizens of Beijing have to wear mask when they walk around the city so that they don't get sick or poisoned from the carbon emissions. Even a 1st world country, like France, had carbon emissions that rivaled BeijingSource 2. So as you can see, the emissions that cars give off could become a more serious issue in America, especially if you live in a place like New York City. If more cities become less congested, they will be much safer.

Speaking of New York City, cars are already a big issue. If you have been to New York City, you should know that the streets are so congested with traffic that it is faster to walk or ride a bike to get around the city. Not only are the streets congested, the air is very polluted from the emissions given off by cars. However, in Vauban, Germany, residents are giving up their cars for streets that are mostly ""carfree"" Source 1. Few residents own cars and that means that the streets are quiet and clear and greenhouse emission have drastically decreased. Residents say that they are happier without cars and everything they need is within walking distance Source 1. This could quite possibly be what happens to many cities and suburbs in the near future.

The last thing that I would like to fill you in on is that car ownership in America has been steadily declining. Research has shown that the number of young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 Source 4. Because of this, many people use Public Transport to get where they need to go. This is likely due to the fact that many Americans don't have the money to buy cars, so they don't make it a priority Source 4. Also, young people feel less inclined to drive because they can connect with their friends through the internet Source 4.

By no means am I saying that you should not own a car, I'm am just explaining to you that a carlimited future is looking more and more possible. In many ways it could be very beneficial, but it still has a long way to go before I can see it becoming reality."
cd3b5043,1,"Dear Senator, I am not alone when I say that I'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. According to the gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the electoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.

When Americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. The popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that's not what the people are voting for. When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors they in turn vote for the president. Voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.

In the 2000 presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but Bush won the election due the amont of electoral votes over powering the popular votes. This completely goes against what the people want. The state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please.

During a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. When there is a tie, the election is sent to the House of Representatives. Due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for Congress, the House's selection will barely reflect the will of the people. Their votes can be the complete opposites of the people's vote. You could help us bring an end to the Electoral College."
cd53e658,0,"In many ways, driving is a great resource. But with this great resource, comes flaws. When cars burn gas made of fossil fuels, it causes many environmental disadvantages. Limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet everyone in many ways.

To start, one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog. Smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exhaust and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans. In Paris, in 2014, driving was banned because of smog. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plated the following day."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This quote from the source shows that because Paris is such a huge and global city, the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution. This crazy amount of pollution created smog in Paris. In fact, according to the article, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This type of pollution is know for causing certain kinds of cancer in people, and is what is thought to be the reason for the Ozone hole above antarctica. Not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution. In Vauban, Germany, the ""streets are completely carfree'"" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars A resident from this suburb said ""'When I had a car I was Always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Heidrun Walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responsibility and worry that comes with driving her children place to place.

Another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits walking, riding bikes as well as keeps pollution levels down with car pooling and other different means of travel. ""Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spears to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota This car free day program in Bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city. Skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exersise. Also, if some peopkle so choose to take the bus, they are still helping to make the city, and world, more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution. There are also trends within the youth of the United States that shows a decrease in wanting to drive. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 1639yearolds getting a license..."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture This shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license. Most teenagers these days don'r see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenominon. ""He Mr. Sivak and I have similar observations about our children. Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy."" This was stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal Source 4: The End of Car Culture Rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids. Many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive, but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore. Most young people see a car as ""just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt work."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture With this disinterest, there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars, and cause a much healthier future for Earth and the people who inhabit it.

In conclusion, by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages. Of these advantages are a healthier life style, and the reduction of pollution and smog. Both of these would lead to a happier and healthier Earth for humans, and the future of human kind to exist and live on."
